(1) Use the transvectants to get the full set of invariants up to A(2) 
    manipulate the matlab output
    look into basis argument from Olver to explain choice from this

(2) Verify Robert's calculations for the moving frame

(3) Experiments
    Break the explanation into 2 -> short version for paper 1, long for paper 2
    Noise experiment
    Spot the group experiment
